# âš¡ Pure Data Case Study â€“ EPÄ°AÅž Data Visualization

This project is a data analytics and visualization tool developed using **Python** and **Streamlit**, focused on retrieving and visualizing electricity market data from the **EPÄ°AÅž Transparency Platform API**. 

It allows users to select energy organizations and view data such as:

- Day-Ahead Market (DAM)
- Intra-Day Market (IDM)
- Bilateral Contracts
- Finalized Daily Production Plan (FDPP)
- Real-time Production

## ðŸ§  Features

- Interactive organization selection
- Visualization of market data using Altair (line/bar charts)
- Real-time production and finalized plans
- Modular codebase for easier maintenance

## ðŸ“¦ Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- `pandas`
- `requests`
- `streamlit`
- `altair`
